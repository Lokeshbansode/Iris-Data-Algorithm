# Iris-Data-Algorithm

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization.

The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two. This means that we can draw a line (or a hyperplane in higher-dimensional spaces) between Iris Setosa samples and samples corresponding to the other two species.

Predicted Attribute: Different Species of Iris plant.

# Observations

Using Petals over Sepal for training the data gives a much better accuracy.
This was expected as we saw in the heatmap above that the correlation between the Sepal Width and Length was very low whereas the correlation between Petal Width and Length was very high.
